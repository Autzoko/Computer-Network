# LAB 1  Implementation of Web Server by Java Under Windows Environment

## Introduction

This is the first LAB experiment of *Computer Network* course in BJTU. The aim of this experiment is to basically learn how to connect between a server and a client by using HTTP protocol. In my lab, I devide the **Server** and **Client** into two folders, as shown benethe, both of them utilizing Java Socket as the main method to build connection and connect. The codes are learned from Internet with the key words: *How to implement server-client structure by Java.* Due to the unfamiliarity of Java language, this programming really took my time. However it is great to basically know how to program with Java, and I will implement the GUI interface soon.

## To Connect with Other Host(Terminal)

Change the IP address(currently *"localhost"*) to target IP address in **./server/src/HttpServer.java**

## Codes Analysis

### HttpServer.java


### HttpClient.java


## TODO

Implement GUI interface of both Server and Client.
